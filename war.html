        The Indian Army, also called the British Indian Army, was involved in World War 
        I as part of the British Empire. More than one million Indian troops served 
        overseas, of whom more than 60,000 died during the war.

        In World War I the Indian Army fought against the German Empire on the Western 
        Front. At the First Battle of Ypres, Khudadad Khan became the first Indian to
        be awarded a Victoria Cross. Indian divisions were also sent to Egypt, Gallipoli, 
        German East Africa and nearly 700,000 served in Mesopotamia against the Ottoman 
        Empire.[2] While some divisions were sent overseas others had to remain in India 
        guarding the North West Frontier and on internal security and training duties.
            
        Field-Marshal Sir Claude Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army from
        1942 asserted that the British "couldn't have come through both World War I and 
        II if they hadn't had the Indian Army."
        In 1914, the Indian Army was one of the two largest volunteer armies in the world; 
        it had a total strength of 240,000 men[8] while the British Army had a strength of 
        247,433 regular volunteers at the outbreak of the war. By November 1918, the Indian 
        Army contained 548,311 men, being considered the Imperial Strategic Reserve.[9] It 
        was regularly called upon to deal with incursions and raids on the North West Frontier 
        and to provide garrison forces for the British Empire in Egypt, Singapore and China.

        The Indian Army during World War II, a British force also referred to as the British 
        Indian Army, began the war, in 1939, numbering just under 200,000 men. By the 
        end of the war, it had become the largest volunteer army in history, rising to over 
        2.5 million men in August 1945. Serving in divisions of infantry, armour and a 
        fledgling airborne force, they fought on three continents in Africa, Europe and Asia.
        The army fought in Ethiopia against the Italian Army, in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and 
        Algeria against both the Italian and German armies, and, after the Italian surrender, 
        against the German Army in Italy. However, the bulk of the Indian Army was committed 
        to fighting the Japanese Army, first during the British defeats in Malaya and the 
        retreat from Burma to the Indian border; later, after resting and refitting for the 
        victorious advance back into Burma, as part of the largest British Empire army ever 
        formed. These campaigns cost the lives of over 87,000 Indian servicemen, while 34,354 
        were wounded, and 67,340 became prisoners of war.Their valour was recognised 
        with the award of some 4,000 decorations, and 18 members of the Indian Army were 
        awarded the Victoria Cross or the George Cross. Field Marshal Claude Auchinleck, 
        Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army from 1942, asserted that the British "couldn't 
        have come through both wars (World War I and II) if they hadn't had the Indian Army.
        " British Prime Minister Winston Churchill also paid tribute to "The unsurpassed 
        bravery of Indian soldiers and officers."
